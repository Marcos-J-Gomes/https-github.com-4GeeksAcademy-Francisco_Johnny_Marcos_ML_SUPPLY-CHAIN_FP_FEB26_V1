## Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying logistical bottlenecks and predicting delivery risks within the **DataCo Global Supply Chain** dataset. Our team is leveraging advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning to transform raw shipping data into actionable business intelligence.

### The Team
* **Francisco (F)**: Lead Data Visualization & Cleaning
* **Johnny (J)**: Supervised Learning & Risk Prediction
* **Marcos (M)**: Unsupervised Clustering & Segmentation

### Team Collaboration & Strategic Goals

Our workflow is built on a circular feedback loop where EDA insights directly inform model architecture:

| Feature Lead | Primary Strategic Goal | Technical Ownership |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **F, J & M** | **Data Integrity & Visualization** | Optimization of high-cardinality features (Zipcodes) and multi-variate correlation analysis to reduce noise. |
| **F, J & M** | **Predictive Risk Assessment** | Developing a Supervised Random Forest model to minimize 'Late Delivery' overhead for the business. |
| **F, J & M** | **Strategic Segmentation** | Utilizing Unsupervised K-Means clustering to identify high-value/low-risk regional hubs. |

### Integrated Workflow
1. **Pre-processing (The Team):** Engineering the `data/processed` layer to ensure consistent scaling and normalization for all models.
2. **Modeling (The Team):** Implementing both Supervised and Unsupervised approaches to provide a 360-degree view of Supply Chain health.
3. **Synthesis (The Team):** Combining individual metrics into a unified project dashboard.

## Key Discoveries (EDA Phase)

### Geographical Concentration
Through coordinate mapping, we discovered a significant data cluster centered in **Puerto Rico (Caguas)**. This localized concentration is a primary factor in the supply chain's performance metrics.

### Addressing High Cardinality
We successfully engineered a solution for high-cardinality features such as `Customer_Zipcode`. By implementing a custom factorization and JSON mapping system, we preserved data integrity while optimizing the dataset for model training.

### Multicollinearity Management
Our correlation analysis identified extreme redundancy in financial metrics (Sales vs. Price vs. Profit). We streamlined the feature set by dropping variables with a **1.00 correlation**, reducing model noise and improving computational efficiency.
